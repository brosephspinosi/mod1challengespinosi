# Rutgers Coding Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge

## Description

This challenge was designed to show how one may refactor code for an on-the-job ticket. Web accesibility was the emphasis of this refactor, restructuring parts of the code given to ensure this goal. An example of this would be adding alt text to an image, furthering accsibility if one is unable to view it.

This refactor also involved examining code to ensure that elements or attributes are organized logically or sequentially.
